    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><span>Except for 3c products, AliExpress is also famous for its fashion style. While we face a problem that more than ninety per cent of our sellers are Chinese sellers who are experienced in making clothes for Asian marketplaces. So the size of most clothes is designed and manufactured for Asian customers in their sizes, not for people from North America or Europe. </span></p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p><strong>Constant changes of business strategy: </strong>
The 2017 AliExpress 11.11 started in Nov.11th 00:00 am (Pacific Time). While in 2018, we changed it to Nov.11th 00:00 am ( Australian Eastern Daylight Time). Yet, in 2019, a decision to change is back to Nov.11th 00:00 am (Pacific Time) was made. The constant changes will put a lot of pressure on us to help users understand the right time of beginning and ending.<br><br>

<strong>Fast Knowledge Accumulation:</strong>
Even though we got colleges from all over the world, that doesn’t mean we are able to come up with the most suitable date formates for our users. To find the most suitable date formates for users in 18 major languages, many  preparation works need to be done.<br><br>

<strong>Not only content, but also coding knowledge: </strong>
For many years, we wrote pure content for every year’s double eleven. While in this project, we are going to make design components supported with back-end machine-generated data.</p>


    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>Read and accumulate as much knowledge as possible. Get support from our content team and people who have culture background. Get on well with our developer. Last but not the least, be a good guy :)</p>


    <h2>The Choice of Pacific Time</h2>
    <p>The 2019 AliExpress 11.11 Global Shopping Festival starts in Nov.11th 00:00 (Pacific time), shown below are time and dates of all our major markets. (Some countries may have multiple timezones, here we take their capital cities for example). It’s of great importance to convey the right date and time to our users and make sure that they are able to get the best deals during the whole year in AliExpress.</p>

    <h2>Date Elements</h2>
    <p>Elements shown below are the key date elements, elements marked with green are the required elements, marked with yellow are optional for 11.11.</p>

    <h2>Localized Way to Describe</h2>
    <h5>12-hour clock & 24-hour clock</h5><p>People in the US may prefer 12-hour clock, while in France，Singapore，Russia, 24-hour clock can be better.</p>
    <h5>Timezone</h5><p>For the expression of localized timezone, some have abbreviations: Pacific Standard Time (PST)，Moscow Standard Time (MSK). While others don’t: Paris Time, Mardrid Time.</p>
    <h5>Daylight Saving Time</h5><p>The daylight saving time do have great influence on the calculation of time. Take Los Angeles (US) as an example，the daylight saving time starts from Mar.10th 2019 to Nov.03rd 2019，time difference between Beijing (China) and Los Angeles (US) is 15 hours. When it comes to Nov.11th 2019, time difference increase from 15 hours to 16 hours.</p>
    <h5>Joint Mark</h5><p>Joint mark will appear when we mention a period of time. Most countries prefer en dash ‘ - ’，others may use Mathematical symbol ‘～’ to connect (such as Japan and Korea) .</p>
    <h5>Reading Order</h5><p>People in most countries around the world read from ‘month-day-year’, while people in CJK (China, Japan, Korea) countries always read ‘year-month-day’.</p>
    <h5>Western Arabic & Eastern Arabic</h5><p>The ten digits we always see in our daily life：0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are Arabic Numerals (or Hindu-Arabic Numerals). It’s different from the Eastern Arabic people use in Middle East Countries: ٠ ١ ٢ ٣ ٤ ٥ ٦  ٧ ٨ ٩</p>

    <h2>Countdown</h2>
    <h5>Length</h5><p>We basicly have four of our key elements for 11.11 countdown: days, hours, minures and seconds. To give more choices to our designers, options in three length: Full, Short and Narrow are provided. (note: some may be the some in short and narrow case.)</p>

    </div>
    <h5>Singular and Plural</h5>
    <p>Different languages have different expressions for singular and plural. What we are familiar in English is to add ’s’ or ‘es’  as a suffix: 1 day, 2 days. While in other language systems, things may be different. Take Russian for example. When it’s 1 day, it’s in ’1 день’; when it comes to two to four days, it’s ‘3 дня’; when it’s more than four days, it’s ‘5 дней’.</p>

    <h5>24h or 48h</h5>
    <p>Under specific business scenarios, the time of countdown will be more than 24 hours. ( Like the 11.11 sale of AliExpress, which lasts for 48 hours.) We’ve prepared two plans and invited some of the colleagues from different countries to see which one they would prefer.</p>

    </div>

    <p>As we can see, though, in a small range, most of my colleagues prefer the first plan. Kyle was the only one who chose the second plan. He holds the view that fewer digits make faster and better understanding.  </p>

    <h2>Front-end & Back-end Development</h2>
    <p>When the content and design patterns are settled down, developers are ready for development.</p>

    <h2>Related OpenType Features</h2>
    <p>OpenType includes layout features—commonly known as OpenType features—that allow fonts to specify alternate letterforms, and rules for how they should be inserted into the text. Llike alternate figures, small caps, ligatures, ordinals, fractions and so on.<br>These OpenType features will help with our final design outputs.</p>

    </div>

    <h5>Proportional numbers and monospaced numbers</h5>
    <p>Proportional numbers have always been the system default option，while monospaced numbers can sometimes serve as the countdown for 11.11 to ensure the stabilization of spacing and layout.</p>

    <h5>Uppercase Forms </h5>
    <p>When it comes to the ‘+’ of GMT+8, the Uppercase Forms can be more friendly and conformably with the layout.</p>

    <h5>Vertically Centered Colon</h5>
    <p>Vertically Centered Colon will be applied default by the system in many cases. When it’s not, adjustments are required in the related Typography settings.</p>
