<h1> Redesign AliExpress <br> for Sign in & Sign up </h1>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><span>It’s been more than 8 years since the first release of AliExpress. We kept fighting for the acquisition of new users and try to hit the goal of DAU (Daily Active User). While barely had we got the changes to do some changes for the global audience. <br><br> Today, we’re excited to introduce a new sign in and sign up flow, including a whole new user interface and all customized functions for users all over the world. </span></p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>No Documentation: There is no documentation about more detailed process such as froget password.<br><br>PD Unwilling to Change: Though the pages seems to be old, there seems no deadly issues.
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>Naturally, I started with the app and PC itself. Working on what issues we may have and what benefits may be brought to us, I dove into the user journey of AliExpress and got a solid handle on all the existing issues and possible new features, by making good use of them, we can bring commercial benefits.</p>

    <h2>Competitor Analysis</h2>
    <p>Competitor Analysis is a good way for us to learn from other apps and websites. Attached are apps that within the range of my competitor Analysis. Please check here for the full competitor analysis.</p>

    <h2>A fresh face that’s all about focus</h2>
    <p>I took the opportunity to optimize our mobile aesthetic for focus and clarity.</p>

    <h2>Made for Mobile and PC</h2>
    <p>1. We used to design seperately for mobile site and PC, now they share the same design. 2. With the design solution for both mobile site and PC, two groups of developers (developers of mobile site and developers of PC) collabrate together and push the whole project online.</p>

    </div>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Bring auto fill mail suffix into the app</h2>
    <p>There will be mail suffix appear automaticlly when user type "@"，and it's related to countries. For instances, @yandex.com will be a choice for Russian user, while @gmail.com should always be a selection for US user.
    <br><br><br><br>

    <br><br><br><br>


    <h2>Clear Definition of touch Points</h2>
    <p>User registration and login behavior occurs on various occasions，it can be at home or on a crowded metro. Thus when user input their password, it should by default be unvisible unless the user ture on the visible option.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <div class="touchpoints">

    </div>

    <br><br><br><br>
    <h2>Smart verification</h2>
    <p>When it's detected that the user had already registered, a popup will appear to notice. And when user switch to login, all the email information will stay there so that it's not nessisary for user to input again.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>

    <h2>Embrace Tech</h2>
    <p>Google smart lock and apple key chain.</p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <div class="embrace">

    </div>
    <br><br><br><br>



    <h2>Design for a global audience</h2>
    <p>1. Intead of using “Sign up” and “Sign in”, “Register” together with “Log in” may be a better choice to help verify <br>2. The recommendation of mail suffix various  from countries to countries<br> 3. The recommendation of SNS various from countries to countries</p>
