    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>1. The swipe rate is low, and the decay is significant. The card swipe rates are 8.17%, 4.79%, 3.42%, 2.64% respectively. An average of 1.5 cards are swiped per user.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. High uniformity is required for the cards, with minimal variations. They heavily rely on copywriting to distinguish between different cards.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. There is limited operational space. After the new card goes live, the optimization is mainly achieved through card placement (placing it as the first card). Given the existing operational and design rules, the optimization space is constrained.</p>

    <h2>Design Solution</h2>
    <p>1. More imaginative design expressions are needed to better showcase and convey the value propositions of different products and services.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. A more imaginative operational space is required, with increased placement for operational copywriting. Atmosphere cards are used to attract attention.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. A more imaginative page container is needed, where card content changes based on the user's scrolling gestures. The information should be more narrative and unfold in a more engaging and intriguing manner.</p>
