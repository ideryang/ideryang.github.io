    <h2>Current Status</h2>
    <p>1. Low Swipe Rate and High Decay: The swipe rates for the cards are relatively low and decrease significantly with each subsequent card, standing at 8.17%, 4.79%, 3.42%, and 2.64%, respectively. On average, users swipe through only 1.5 cards.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. High Uniformity in Card Design: The cards require a high degree of uniformity, with limited variation. The primary differentiator between cards is the copywriting.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Limited Operational Flexibility: Post-launch optimization is largely limited to card placement (e.g., positioning a new card as the first in the sequence). Due to existing operational and design constraints, the scope for further optimization is restricted.</p>

    <h2>Design Solution</h2>
    <p>1. Enhance Design Creativity: Introduce more imaginative design elements to effectively showcase and communicate the unique value propositions of various products and services.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Expand Operational Flexibility: Create a more dynamic operational space with increased opportunities for impactful copywriting. Utilize visually appealing “atmosphere cards” to capture user attention and enhance engagement.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Innovative Page Containers: Develop more creative and interactive page containers where card content dynamically changes based on user scrolling behavior. Present information in a narrative style that unfolds in a captivating and engaging manner.</p>
