<h1> AliExpress

    <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><span>Except for 3c products, AliExpress is also famous for its fashion style. While we face a problem that more than ninety per cent of our sellers are Chinese sellers who are experienced in making clothes for Asian marketplaces. So the size of most clothes is designed and manufactured for Asian customers in their sizes, not for people from North America or Europe. </span></p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Tied to business: The product should always have the potential and finally proved to bring business value.<br><br>Make a difference: AR technology seems novel on mobile, while the implementation of it is not. How to make it stand out and make a difference is a real challenge. <br><br>Play multiple roles at the same time: more communication works are required to be down by acting as a product designer.</p>


    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>To push this project forward. I need to show people the ability of AR technology and at the same time propose a solution to the size and fit problem. Only then can I get engineer resource to help me develop the full function. </p>


    <h2>Feasibility Analysis</h2>
    <p>Since AR Kit released for just a few monthes, I tried to build a mobile AR demo with Xcode to show to people what AR can do with the size and fit problem.</p>

      </video>
    </div>



    <h2>Concept Making</h2>
    <p>Since people were enjoying AR experience brought by the demo I made, I saw more possibility of this project. So I started to move on and spend time on the concept design. If I was lucky enough, people would like my concept and invest in my idea.</p>

    <h2>Problem Finding</h2>
    <p>As part of our job, we keep tracking user feedbacks in our everyday life. Feedbacks about the size and fit problem is one of the worst one among all of them. The average <strong>SNAD rate (Significantly Not as Described) </strong> in our platform is 10%, while the rate of clothing category is more than 20% during our evaluation. </p>

    </div>

    <br>

    <h2>Product Strategy</h2>
    <p>We mainly have three steps to build the whole system.<br><br>1. Data Collection: Collecting the size and fit information of users without doing harm to their privacy<br><br>2. Build Size Library: Put the size and fit information together to build a size library so that user is able to manage their own size and fit information.<br><br>3. A.I. Recommendation: Based on size library built, we’ll finally be able to recommende a suitable size for our customers.</p>

    </div>
    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>Workflow shown below mainly demonstrate the way how user build their own size library from zero to one. Here are two main entrances for user thourghout the whole shopping experience: My Account Page& Product Option Page. </p>
    <div class="small">

    </div>

    <h2>Bring Traffic</h2>
    <p>By opening a new entrance in My Account page, user is able to have easy access to the size library of their own.</p>

    </div>


    <h2>Data Collection & Size Library</h2>
    <p>How to get the date information we want? The first idea occurred to us is to purchase. By consulting our financial and legal team, we got in touch with some of the companies that can provide database we want, while we ended up with some legal issues during the collaboration. <br><br>Thus, we tried another way out: build our own data library by encouraging customers to establish their size library. Here we provide three ways for users to build their size library: <br><br>1. import form order history: select the clothes in the order history to set as your standard size <br><br>2. Measure with AR ruler: AR ruler is an augmented reality ruler that allows people to measure with their mobile phone<br><br>3. input by myself: user will be able to input size and fit information manually to build the library<br><br>4. Machine learning from user’s feedbacks: If there is no size and fit information of our users, machine learning from the keywords of user’s feedbacks will also help. </p>

    </div>

    <h2>A.I. Recommendation</h2>
    <p>There are basiclly two stages of the A.I Recommendation. When there is no size information detected, user reviews can serve as a reference.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Choose Category</h2>
    <p>Found out that the size and fit issues always happened  in the US and Europe, thus we choose categories whose SNAD rate ranked top 5.</p>

    <h2>AR Measure</h2>
    <p>It’s our first time to integrate AR ability into our app with the help AR Kit, which may help with the data collection. </p>
    <div class="small">

    </div>

    <h2>Divide into phases</h2>
    <p>With constant communication with our dev, we finnaly decide to divide whole project into two phases for the lack of engineer resource.</p>



    <h5>Phase one (Online)</h5>
    <p>Integrate AR ability into camera</p>

    <div class="middle">
      <img src="https://ideryang.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/sizelibrary/phase11.png" width=100%>
      <br><br><br>
      <img src="https://ideryang.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/sizelibrary/phase12.png" width=100%>
    </div>


    <h5>Phase two (Failed to be online)</h5>
    <p>Build the whole workflow including size library and A.I. Recommendation.<br><br>Though we planned to push the project online, we didn’t set up any commercial goals and make it clear to all stakeholders. Which make it hard to evaluate if phase one goes fine or not. Finally, the engineer quit the project and I failed to push the phase two online. </p>

    <h2>Our Result</h2>
    <h5>AR Ability</h5>
    <p>It’s our first time to integrate AR ability into our app, which make it possible for user to measure size and fit through AliExpress. </p>

    <h5>AR Lucky Coupon</h5>
    <p>Even though we failed to make the phase two online, the AR Ability we built soon serves as an important ability for Alibaba 11.11 Global Shopping Festival which is known as AR Lucky Coupon: Scan certain patterns, then get lucky coupon.<br><br>AR Lucky Coupon has served as one of the main games of Alibaba 11.11 Global Shopping Festival for 2 years, maybe there is another year. Wish you download and enjoy, thanks. </p>
