<h1> Google Editors' Choice</h1>

<body>
  <p>The Alibaba Group Int. UED team is thrilled to announce that the AliExpress app has received an “Editors’ Choice” award from the Google Play store. There are over 1.5 million apps available on Google Play, but only a small and very selective number of apps have received the Editors’ Choice distinction.<br><br>This is the second distinction that the AE app has received from Google Play—previously achieving a “Top Developer” award. <p>

  <div class="context">



    <h2>Google Play</h2>
    <p>On the international UED team we believe that Google Play is the premier platform for Android apps.<br><br>With over one billion active users from over 190 countries and territories, success on Google Play is critical to growing your app in markets around the world. </p>


    <h2>Editors’ Choice</h2>
    <p>Editors’ Choice is a highly selective collection of the best apps on the platform. Selection is based on a combination of product quality, user interface, long-term popularity, innovative features and compatibility with Android technology, among other factors.</p>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h2>The Road to Editors’ Choice</h2>
    <p>It took over 40 revisions to develop the current version of the AE app, but after the official 4.0 version was released over 8,000 users provided feedback in two days—93% providing a five-star raiding.<br><br>

    For our team, updating AliExpress to adhere to Google’s implementation of Material Design was an important step. As the lead designer of Registration and sign-in process, cart page and whole checkout process, I've gone through tons of projects and meetings to make the design perfect and meet the goal. <br><br>

    Material Design is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of design standards.<br><br>

    With thousands of product listings across dozens of categories, applying Material Design helped our users more easily navigate the AE platform. The intuitive and organized approach of a Material Design-driven interface also created a more efficient shopping experience.<br><br>

    The below image shows a visual breakdown of how the AE team incorporated Material Design into our product listing pages.</p>

    <h2>AliExpress Growth</h2>
    <p>AliExpress continues to grow in markets around the world, and now supports 18 languages with users in 230 countries and territories.<br><br>

    We will continue to innovate and develop the AE platform, focusing on our users and partners as the source of innovation.<br><br>

    Many thanks to Google Play for the distinction!
