      <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p><span>For every 11.11 in Alibaba group, we keep thinking about how to bring benefits as well as joy at the same time to the customers all over the world. We wanted to create games of great fun with innovative interactions. Sound is one of the keys of this project, we have the passion to say ‘Hello World’, at the same time, we are eager to hear the sound of the world which came from a different area, different countries from different people. </span></p>

    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
    <p>Make it happens: The Global Shopping Festival is the biggest shopping event in Alibaba Group, and no team had invested in a game played with sound ever before, people may like the idea while they are at the same time worried about the risk it may bring.<br><br>Find the balance: The money of coupons always comes from both sellers and platform. We are supposed to bring fun to the users, bring benefits to the sellers and platform. Achieve both without interrupting users.<br>


    <h2>My Approach</h2>
    <p>My process started from a quick prototype to communicate with the developers and our business team. The more detailed design came next. Here are some key elements.</p>




    <h2>Quick Prototype</h2>
    <p>Double Eleven Global Shopping Festival happens on Nov.11th. While if we are going to push a new project online. We should be fast. I want to emphasis the interaction between our shopping festival and the users, so we focused on some main areas.</p>

    </div>


    <h2>Act and Talk</h2>
    <p>Since we already had a prototype, we can now talk to people in different roles and get some feedback to improve the idea. Of course, those people will and should play an important role as the project going on.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Team up</h2>
    <p>We had a basic version, now based on the feedback given by people, we were supposed to have a better version and bring solutions to the problems mentioned by people. Here are some of the changes for the plan1:<br><br>1. Bring more traffic to the seller in exchange for the bonus for the game<br>2. Add more design details such as the ‘Terms and conditions’<br>3. Have a more lightweight way to play<br>4. Make it some ‘visual’<br><br>After all the changes I’ve made. I invited people related to a meeting and show them how it worked with sound. The result came out good, people agreed to the whole idea and then we teamed up.</p>

    </div>


    <h2>Setup Goals</h2>
    <p>After several meetings with developers, business team and marketing team. We decided to make it the most important game of this year’s double eleven. And we need to setup some goals for this project to evaluate the ROI from the business’es perspective.</p>
    <h5>Eommercial Goals</h5>
    <p>Bring significant growth of the AliExpress <strong>DAU (Daily Active User) </strong>during the Double Eleven Global Shopping Festival</p>




    <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
    <p>At this point we were happy with the overall look we’d achieved, but creating a single map visualization was tedious. We needed a way to accelerate the process and scale it up.</p>
    <h5>Page Flow</h5>
    <p>Through the page flow attached below, we found out that: <strong>It’s may be not so convient for the user to find the game.</strong>  <br><br>Because there are so many entrances, animations and colors during the 11.11 on the App homepage and Main Venue, user may miss the game without even knowing it.</p><br><br><br>
    <div class="pageflow">

    </div>

    <h5>Attract more traffic</h5>
    <p>We added a few entrances to make sure user have the acess to the game.</p><br><br><br>

    <div class="traffic">

    </div>

    <h5>Bring benefits to the bussiness</h5>
    <p>Based on the Commercial goals, we found out that actually, we were able to do more. <br><br>1. Bring users back by daily tasks to increase DAU (Daily Active User), such as the design of tab ‘Today’ and ‘Tomorrow’<br><br>2. Divide the one day task into several rounds, so that people can come and play without worrying about all expired tasks. (If the money provided by the seller all ran out, the task will turn into expired)</p><br><br><br>
    <div class="benefits">

    </div>


    <h5>Bring more fun</h5>
    <p>Not only can we play with the store slogan, but also what’s trending right now. Collobrated with our marketing team, we were able to do more with this part. </p><br><br><br>
    <div class="fun">

    </div>



    <h2>Embrace Changes</h2>
    <p>What keep changing is the changes itself. We planed well as a team and then take responsibility for our own work. <br><br>While Project manager together with developers came and synchronize the information below:<br><br>1. We were not able to recognize the exact word of the user, while we can track the volume of the sound.<br><br>2. We got enough money for the game, so there is no necessity to talk the sellers into our process.<br><br>3. We failed to connect with HBO or BBC<br><br>4. We don’t have the resource to develop Voice search on search page  </p>




    <h2>A more simply version</h2>
    <p>Actually it shouldn’t be called start over, since we made it to have a team and enough budget for users to play and get coupons. And this time, we made is super easy:<br><br>The louder you shout, the bigger coupon you will get!<br><br>And this time, visual and the feeling for game become important. </p><br><br><br>

      </video>
    </div>

    <h2>Key Point</h2>
    <p>1. Use vibration to emphasize the breakthrough of each stage: Users are less likely to stare at the interface while holding their mobile phone and shout to the MIC.<br><br>2. Communicate more with the developers about the relationship between Time, dB (deciBel) of the sound, length of the progress bar.<br><br>3. Make sure to add a game loading process, cause not all users have a good network condition. </p>



    <h2>Our Result</h2>
    <h5>Metric</h5>
    <p>More than 400,000 users came and played every single day. From which we can say that the game does help with the DAU. And with a super good ROI (Return on investment), we brought a considerable amount of GMV to our platform by giving out AliExpress Coupons and Store Coupons. </p>
    <h5>Patent</h5>
    <p>Besides the commercial benefits, we’ve also applied and got two patents, one for invention (A13193-MP1723628), one for design (CZ1736086 A13194D). (Make sure you’ve applied for the patent before the project goes online, otherwise)</p>
    <h5>The Birth of Voice Search</h5>
    <p>Even though the voice search function is not ready for the shout for the coupon. While right after the project, we dived directly into the voice search and make it one of the key function now on AliExpress. </p>
    <br><br><br><br>
    <p>Shout for coupon has served as one of the main games of Alibaba Global Shopping Festival for 2 years, maybe there is another year. Wish you download and enjoy, thanks. </p>
